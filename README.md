# About ChatCat

ChatCat is a Discord Bot focused around being similar to Yggdrasil's Userphone command, but with improvements.

It can (decently-easily) be integrated into any Discord.JS Typescript (**js requires other similar steps**) bot by copying and adapting the [Bot](https://github.com/0J3/ChatCat-Bot/)'s [Userphone Command](https://github.com/0J3/ChatCat-Bot/blob/main/ts/commands/userphone.ts) code and adding the [Necesary Directory](https://github.com/0J3/ChatCat-Bot/blob/main/ts/cc-classes) containing some classes to the parent directory of the Userphone Command's directory.

You can also clone [this](https://nora.lgbt/soon#Repository) repository (soon)

## This is the repository for the ChatCat Site

It will be completed once the bot is finished
